# The Promise and Progress of AI in Healthcare

Artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative technology in healthcare, showing immense potential to improve patient outcomes while reducing costs. From conquering cancer to managing population health, AI tools are demonstrating new feats daily. However, as with any powerful technology, AI also brings risks that must be carefully managed.  

A major area where AI is gaining traction is clinical documentation and administrative workflows. Natural language processing systems can generate physician notes, freeing up doctors to focus more on patients.
